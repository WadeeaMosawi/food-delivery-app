Full-Stack Food Delivery App – React Native & Appwrite
During my learning journey, I built a full-stack cross-platform food delivery application using React Native (with Expo) for the frontend and Appwrite as the backend service. The app was designed to run smoothly on both iOS and Android, with a focus on scalability, clean UI/UX, and real-time monitoring.
Overview
The goal of this project was to replicate the core functionalities of a modern food delivery app such as Talabat or Uber Eats. I implemented user authentication, menu browsing, search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, and error monitoring. On the backend, I used Appwrite to handle user accounts, database collections, and file storage, which made the app production-ready.
This project not only helped me strengthen my mobile development skills but also gave me hands-on experience in integrating a BaaS (Backend as a Service), handling state management, and implementing real-time error monitoring with Sentry.

Detailed Description
1. Tech Stack
•	Frontend: React Native (Expo) for cross-platform development
•	Styling: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
•	Backend: Appwrite (authentication, database, file storage)
•	Monitoring: Sentry (error and performance tracking)
•	State Management: Zustand (for cart and global states)
2. Core Features I Built
•	Authentication: Google OAuth login and session-based access control.
•	Navigation: Multi-tab navigation with dedicated screens (Home, Search, Cart, Profile).
•	Dynamic Search & Filtering: Users can search for meals and filter by categories.
•	Shopping Cart System: Add/remove items, update quantities, and calculate totals in real time.
•	Database Integration: Menu items and user data fetched directly from Appwrite collections.
•	Error Monitoring: Sentry integration to capture crashes, bugs, and performance issues.
3. Development Process
1.	Setup & Styling: Configured React Native with Expo and styled the app using NativeWind.
2.	Navigation & UI: Built clean UI screens with tab navigation.
3.	Authentication: Integrated Google login through Appwrite.
4.	Backend Setup: Created collections in Appwrite for menus, users, and orders, and seeded sample data.
5.	Cart Logic: Implemented cart state using Zustand for smooth item management.
6.	Search & Filtering: Added dynamic menu browsing with search queries and filters.
7.	Monitoring: Connected Sentry to capture app errors and monitor performance.
8.	Final Testing: Verified navigation, cart, and auth flows to ensure production readiness.
4. Learning Outcomes
•	Strengthened my skills in React Native and cross-platform development.
•	Gained real-world experience with backend as a service (Appwrite).
•	Learned state management patterns for scalable mobile apps.
•	Understood the importance of error tracking and observability (via Sentry).
•	Practiced building a production-style app from scratch with authentication, database, and cart functionality.
